# LIRI

CLI app that takes in user-definied parameters and returns a spotify song, movie, or event.
User can use the following commands `concert-this artist` `spotify-this-song song` `movie-this movie` and LIRI will return information related to the events/concerts, the spotify song, or movie that the user specifies.
To get started, you'll need an API key for spotify, packages for axios, node-spotify-api, and moment to convert a date string into MM-DD-YYYY format.
Another feature includes a `do-what-it-says` command and will look up the command in the random.txt file.
